# Space Blasters
Space Blasters is a 2d cross-platform retro space shooter game created with <a href='https://www.kivy.org'>Kivy</a> and Python.

The player needs to shoot the incoming enemy ships achieving an ever-increasing high score. The game does not have end, except when the player dies, so as the time goes enemy ships are getting faster and harder to beat.
There are also randomly appearing drops that help the player to survive.
